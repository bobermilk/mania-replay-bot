example command:
>render -scroll 29 -rate 1.4 -skin bar -from 00:01:23 -to 00:03:42 -force 

scroll = scroll speed
rate  = map rate
skin  = bar/circle/arrow/diamond
from  = start timestamp
to    = end timestamp
force = videos will be split if the rendered video is larger than 8mb

svs do not work as of now.
